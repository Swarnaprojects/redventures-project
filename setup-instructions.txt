Windows 10, 64 bit and Chrome ("user" below is referring to current user logged into the windows machine)

1. mkdir webdriverio-test in "C:\Users\user" directory.

2. cd webdriverio-test

3. Install Selenium standalone server from "http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/3.5/selenium-server-standalone-3.5.3.jar" into 
   webdriverio-test directory.

4. Make sure Java is installed, JAVA_HOME is set and Path variable has %JAVA_HOME%\bin

5. Install chromedriver for windows 32 from "https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.41/"

6. Make sure chromedriver is extracted to "C:\Users\user\Downloads\chromedriver" folder and Path variable has C:\Users\user\Downloads\chromedriver

7. Assuming node.js and npm is already installed, download webdriverio using command "npm install webdriverio".

8. Copy the wdio.conf file from config to "C:\Users\user\node_modules\.bin directory". Refer to wdio-conf-instructions if you want to create
   from scratch.

9. Copy the tests (js files) from tests folder into "C:\Users\user\node_modules\.bin\test\specs" (Need to create the directory test\specs first).

10. In the command prompt where you are in the webdriverio-test directory, run the command: "java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.5.3.jar"

11. Open a new command prompt and navigate to "C:\Users\user\node_modules\.bin" directory.

12. Run the command "wdio wdio.conf.js" which will start executing the tests. Some basic tests have been automated. Login page test does not
    pass because of the issue with duplicate id (multiple elements on same page having same id which is not being honored by chromedriver, 
    complains that it is in a invalid state while trying to update the input username and password).

13. The test cases are documented in docs folder.

14. Overall 8 test cases pass and 1 fails but I have only automated these basic test cases.
